        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>SEO is about creating a good online presence
            and making yourself visible to users, making your link more likely
            to get clicked. Once you have achieved a higher ranking, more people will see
        you as an authority in your field and it becomes easier to create
        a good customer base. </p>

        <h2>Selection of keywords</h2>
        <p>
            A good way to start is by making a list of relevant keywords
            related to your business and plug each one into a Google search and see what happens.
            To test that theory, Jon Rognerud from <a href="entreprenuer.com" target="_blank">entreprenuer.com</a>
            wrote up a checklist of 4 steps to get you started.

        <p>By determining who is competing for your selected keywords, you are able to research
            your competition and find words that describe the intent and theme of your content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="point-block">
        <h2>Title tags</h2>
        <p>
            After you do your keywords research, you want to place 3-5 of them into
            the meta tags section in the HTML code of your page. According to WordStream,
            “There are 4 different types of meta tags - meta keywords attribute,
            title tag, meta description attribute and the meta robots attribute (WordStream article)”.
        </p>
        <h3>Keywords meta tag</h3>
        <p>
            They suggest that the keywords attribute is old news
        because Google doesn’t use them in their ranking algorithm anymore.
        Simply put, internet marketers would insert keywords that were
        unrelated to their content into their source code in attempt to get
        more page hits to their site. This would steal traffic from sites
        that actually were about the content keywords so Google got smart
        and decided to devalue the tool.
        </p>
        <h3>Title meta tag</h3>
        <p>
            The folks at Wordstream stress the importance of the title tag
            as a means for your keywords to get the most successful SEO outcome.
            Title tags have a real impact on search engine because these
            titles are visible to the average user.

        </p>
        <h3>What to write</h3>
        <p>When you place keywords in the meta tags section of your HTML code,
            you want words that reflect the intent and theme of the page.
            Using phrases is also helpful and will allow search engines
            to quickly determine what the page is about.</p>
        <p>To take a closer look into these search engine rankings for your chosen keywords,
            do some tests and record your findings in a spreadsheet. It is also a good idea
            to refresh your keywords and add new ones from time to time to improve search engine rankings.</p>

        <h2>SEO or PPC</h2>
        <p>
            As a business your biggest concern is converting online traffic
            and clicks into sales. If you are on the top of Search Engine Results Pages,
            people are more likely to visit your website. There are two ways to get there&mdash;SEO and PPC.
        </p>
        <h3>People's trust</h3>
        <p>
            Research shows that sites that use SEO have a higher probability of getting
            visited than those that use PPC (pay-per-click). This is because more people
            trust the organic result more than
            the top result which is payed for to get a higher ranking.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this depends on the business area.
            For example, research shows that with searches related to electronics
            and computers, the user is less likely to click on the first three search
            results than a user searching for sites related to finance and insurance.
        </p>
        <h3>Time and money</h3>
        <p>
            PPC-advertising works instantly but can get expensive fast&mdash;the more you pay,
            the higher the ranking will be.

            SEO takes week or months but you don’t have to pay for traffic.
            Although, most companies still have to hire professionals to create their websites
            and help them with SEO.
        </p>
        <h3>Up-to-date</h3>
        <p>
            There is also another concern which SEO-users need to be aware about.
            With search engines constantly working to update and improve their algorithms,
            that also increases the risk of your SEO-page to lose its ranking,
            if it is not up to date with the changes. A lot of hard work can
            get wiped out very quickly, and by using PPC you can ensure that
            your site keeps its place in the SERP.
