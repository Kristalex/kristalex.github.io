			<a href="purchases-personas.html" target="_blank">Based on personas</a>, the first step for users in our app
			is searching for purchases.
			In the early beginning of designing a search form, we were eager to make
			the form with a minimum amount of fields. By series of usability
			testings and surveys, we revealed the key scenario. It included only two fields
			and some default settings for all users. That was our first search form, and it really worked.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a while, we started to receive messages from our users asking to add this or that field.
			We resisted as we could because we didn’t want the form to become a&nbsp;monster.
			But the form was slowly growing anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			In our defense, every change we made was proved that it’s necessary.
			We watched users search requests, we accumulated users with the same feedback,
			we listened to sellers why users refused to buy, we explored and tested our competitors.

				We calculated that usage of&nbsp;categories was far less than usage of&nbsp;keywords, so&nbsp;that categories were moved to "Show more&nbsp;options".</p>
				<p><b>Status</b><br>
				We added archive purchases to a&nbsp;search, and placed a&nbsp;purchase status as&nbsp;a&nbsp;filter above&nbsp;results.</p>

				<p>We changed it back. The problem was that users were confused by&nbsp;one line
				instead of two text&nbsp;inputs. They thought that it was a&nbsp;label under the&nbsp;line
				and wrote everything in one field below.</p>
				<p>But it can't be one field, because searching
				by unstructured request worsen search results quality. Besides, our users have
				strict parameters of what they want, and it's better to give them two fields
				than to&nbsp;teach how to&nbsp;request.</p>

					Status was moved to "Show more options" as not concerned with the main scenario.

					<b>Type</b><br>
					Users appeared to be divided into several groups by participating in only one type of purchases.

					<b>Publish date</b><br>
