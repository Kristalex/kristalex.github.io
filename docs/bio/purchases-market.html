		<h2 class="g-h2">Market</h2>
		<p>
			In Russia, if companies need to buy goods or services, they place their needs on special websites.
			We&nbsp;call these needs purchases. Suppliers search for purchases to provide&nbsp;services.
		</p>
		<h2 class="g-h2">Mission</h2>
		<p>
			We&nbsp;aggregate purchases and help suppliers to&nbsp;find them. After searching, we help to organize and analyse&nbsp;purchases.
		</p>
		<h2 class="g-h2">Competitors</h2>
		<ul class="g-list">
			<li>a free government website</li>
			<li>a number of paid websites with the&nbsp;same&nbsp;goal</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We bet on a good search and usability. In design and implementation of every feature, we followed UX best practices.
			Our strategy was not based on first to&nbsp;market, but best to&nbsp;market.
			And it paid&nbsp;of. The product is still growing and already has over 10000&nbsp;users.
		</p>
		<h2 class="g-h2">Problems we solved</h2>
		<ol class="g-list">
			<li>
				Before: Users couldn't access purchases because the government website was often unavailable.<br>
				Now: We create a&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;system.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before: Users couldn't find anything because there was a lot of irrelevant search results on the government website.<br>
				Now: Our search engine is much more efficient.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before: Users spent about 20 minutes a day on composing search requests.<br>
				Now: They can save regular requests and get purchases every morning by email&nbsp;automatically.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before: Users went to special courses to study what all information means and how to&nbsp;work on the&nbsp;government website.<br>
				Now: We&nbsp;simplify scenarios, omit unnecessary information, make a&nbsp;purchase page readable and&nbsp;concise.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before: Users had to create an offline storage for purchases to continue to work with them.<br>
				Now: They have an online storage for interesting purchases&mdash;Favourites.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before: Users didn't know when something changes in their purchases&mdash;it could be a reason to fail participation.<br>
				Now: We monitor changes in favourite purchases and notify users about it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Before: Users could loose their money by choosing customers who don’t pay properly or have always the same winners.<br>
				Now: There's a page for every company with its participation data to analyze.
			</li>
