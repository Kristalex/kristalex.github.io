        <h2>Trademark Law</h2>
        <p>
            Trademarks are commonly confused with copyrights and patents. All three protect some form of intellectual property, but each corresponds to a distinct area. For instance, copyrights only apply to artistic or literary works, while patents are explicitly for inventions, Trademarks protect elements of a company brand identity. For example, distinct brand names and logos can be trademarked since they relate to a company image.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In order to be protectable, trademarks must be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). </li>
            <li>Once registered, the owner has responsibility to monitor any unauthorized use of their mark. </li>
            <li>If a case of infringement were to go unnoticed by the owner, it is possible that they could lose ownership of the mark.
            </li>
            <li>The increase in internet accessibility has made this an easier task for trademark owners, and has correlated with an uptick in infringement allegations.
            </li>
            <li>Leading the reader to conclude that your site is connected with or endorsed by a trademarked product or owner can lead to your liability.
            </li>
            <li>Any link that falsely leads the end user to conclude that the web page author is affiliated, approved, or sponsored by the trademark owner could lead to a claim of trademark infringement [1].
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="point-block">
        <h2>Linking and Framing</h2>
        <p>Generally adding links to a website does not present any legal issues or obligations. The physical act of writing an HTML link does not convey any endorsement, authorship, or ownership [3].
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No permission is required when providing the name or publicly accessible URL (Web address) for any website [2].
            </li>
            <li>Third party pages and images should not be linked into the frame [1].
            </li>
            <li>When viewing framed information, your computer is connected to the site doing the framing - NOT the site whose page appears in the frame [2].</li>
            <li>Framing is generally unpopular with websites whose content is framed on another site (unless they have agreed to it).
            </li>
            <li>Websites that frame the content of other sites are often seen as stealing the other site content [2].
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Domain Name Law</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to web law and domain names, most of the issues center around Domain Name Disputes. That is, who really has the right to own a certain domain name? Even with a properly registered site, you may find yourself on either side of a dispute, so it is a good idea to understand the basics
        </p>
        <p>In order to dispute someone using a domain name, you must prove that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the name is the same (or confusingly similar) to your registered name,</li>
            <li>the other party has no legitimate business interest in it, and
            </li>
            <li>that the domain name was registered and used in bad faith</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Ways you can prove your right to a domain name is by showing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the name is the same (or confusingly similar) to your registered name,</li>
            <li>the other party has no legitimate business interest in it, and
            </li>
            <li>that the domain name was registered and used in bad faith</li>
            <li>the domain name was used prior to any notice of the dispute.
            </li>
            <li>you have been commonly known by the second level domain name, or
            </li>
            <li>you are making fair use of the domain name, without intent of commercial gain, misleadingly diverting consumers, or tarnishing the trademark at issue.
            </li>
        </ul>
